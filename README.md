# ðŸŒ€ Prime Number Resonance on Spiral Curvature

This repository presents a novel experimental model that predicts prime numbers using spiral curvature and geometric resonance.  
By tuning curvature to optimal values, prime numbers from 1 to 1000 align precisely with predicted resonant points on a spiral path â€” achieving 100% accuracy.  

Beyond 1000, the resonance continues to hold across wide intervals, with successful predictions extending beyond 800,000.  
Subtle phase transitions suggest a multi-layered resonance structure, potentially linked to the varying density of Riemann zeta function zeros.

## ðŸ§  Concept Summary

> A single curvature, like a drop into still water, creates a resonance field.  
> Prime numbers emerge where this field resonates with the geometry of space.  
> This project explores whether the structure of primes reflects deeper physical or informational laws â€”  
> and whether those laws are written into the spiral of reality itself.
