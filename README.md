# ðŸŒ€ Prime Number Resonance on Spiral Curvature

This repository presents a novel experimental model that predicts prime numbers using spiral curvature and geometric resonance.  
By tuning curvature to optimal values, prime numbers from 1 to 1000 align precisely with predicted resonant points on a spiral path.  

Beyond 1000, this resonance breaks â€” suggesting a transition zone in prime distribution, potentially linked to Riemann zeta zero density.

## ðŸ§  Concept Summary

> A single curvature, like a drop into still water, creates a resonance field.  
> Prime numbers emerge where this field resonates with the geometry of space.  
> This project explores whether the structure of primes reflects deeper physical or informational laws.
